# Julia Nye - Writer in Training
The writing done for this portfolio has all been completed during the Winter 2024 semester at BYU-Idaho. By creating this website, I am showcasing all 3 parts of my degree as an Interdisciplinary student. I had an emphasis in Creative Writing for Fiction/Film, a minor in Web Development, and a certificate in Digital Marketing.
